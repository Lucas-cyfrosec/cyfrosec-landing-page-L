    ceoMessage: `Today's cybersecurity tools operate in silos, securing code, cloud, endpoints, and infrastructure independently, creating noise, blind spots, and unclear priorities.

At CyfroSec, we take a different approach. We combine network visibility, asset discovery, and deep fingerprinting with code security across SaaS and on-prem environments to deliver AI-driven insights that show you exactly what matters and what to fix first.

We secure modern AI-driven infrastructure from development to deployment and beyond.

Our vision is to build a unified code-to-cloud security platform that protects the entire ecosystem, across everything in between.`,
